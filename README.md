# No CAP(TCHA) - Enhancing CAPTCHA Solvers and Using Adversarial Examples to Make CAPTCHA More Robust

## Overview
In our study, we build on previous work that focuses on breaking Googleâ€™s reCAPTCHA v2 using advanced machine learning-based approaches, specifically object detection. The prior research demonstrates a method that can solve 100% of presented CAPTCHA challenges. However, we have identified several directions for extending this work, which we define as the primary focus of our project.

## Goals
The goals of our study include:

1. **Improving Accuracy and Confidence**
   - Update the object detection model to enhance overall prediction accuracy and confidence.

2. **Enhancing Performance on Type 2 reCAPTCHA v2 Challenges**
   - Fine-tune the existing image segmentation model on a new dataset to improve performance on Type 2 reCAPTCHA v2 challenges.

3. **Exploring Adversarial Examples**
   - Attempt to break the solver using adversarial examples presented in other literature.

## Usage
- Run `solve_recaptcha.py` to solve a single reCAPTCHA challenge:
  ```
  python solve_recaptcha.py
  ```

- Run `test_environment.py` to solve multiple reCAPTCHA challenges and create a log file:
  ```
  python test_environment.py
  ```
